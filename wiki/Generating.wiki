#summary Description of generating constants.

= Using =

Use command-line to create base constants files.

Generator create only base files by user params. Next extending should be do by hand.

To view help of command line type:

{{{
>const_generator --help
}}}

= Example =

Lets see run of next command:

{{{
>const_generator -n generator::main -r date_time current const all_current
}}}

As a result, "Const Generator" should create two files:

"date_time.hpp"
"date_time.cpp"

Internal code should be placed in namespace `generator::main`.

Base type of class is `date_time_t`, and we'll find three child-classes: 
`current_date_time_t`, `const_date_time_t`, `all_current_date_time_t`.

In addition we'll find class `date_time_modes_t`. This class controls all types of constants.
