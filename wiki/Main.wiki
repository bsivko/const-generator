#Introduction in Const Generator.

= Introduction =

Const Generator allow to create classes to support constant variables. 

It's a specific format like enums.

= Details =

This format using when we use constants and we want to extend functionality of them.

== Functional control of all constants ==

If we use simple enum list we can't create a function which can process all of them.

For example, if we want to make list of variables to print. Or found constant with some run-time value.

== Extend constants by additional data == 

Enum-list is simple and can't to extend data, associated with constant. In this case we should create another data structures and create functions to work with them. Such variant is spontaneous and isn't systematic. Organization of this process like "Const Generator" should do this more easy and reliable.

== Easy to extend == 

Extending should be easy, fast and reliable. 

Extending need minimum actions of user to create new constants and allow to control of extending of all data and functions.
